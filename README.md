It already has an unsolved Sudoku puzzle as input and produces a solved puzzle as output.

The solver uses a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible solutions until it finds a valid solution.

# Usage

1.If you want to play, Enter "1".

2.Enter row,column and number you want to enter in that cell.

3.After each step it will tell you whether an invalid move has been hit or not.

4.If solved succesfully you will get a congratulations message in the end.

5.If you are unable to solve, Enter 2 in starting or -1 as all the inputs of row, col and cell number.

6.A possible solution will be given if exists.

7.Otherwise, a pre-written message will be generated.

8.You can continue playing or exit by pressing "3".
